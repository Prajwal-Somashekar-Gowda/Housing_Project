# Housing_Project
This project, HousingU, developed an online application that facilitates the process of finding suitable housing and roommates for college students and city residents. The platform is designed to connect like-minded individuals based on their preferences, habits, and hobbies, enabling them to plan their stay and ensure a harmonious living environment.
